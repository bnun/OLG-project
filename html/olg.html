        Welcome
        The Faith Formation program at Our Lady of Guadalupe is a vital part of our thriving parish.
        In 2014 Our Lady of Guadalupe had a record number of 150 youth confirmed at the Cathedral in
        St. Paul. With numbers like this Our Lady of Guadalupe has an army of strong dedicated volunteers
        that help our youth grow and flourish in the Catholic faith.
